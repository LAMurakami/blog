# AWS S3 in the cloud as a custom domain name static website.

These websites were created by configuring an AWS S3 bucket as a static website and creating DNS entry with a CNAME_target entry matching the Amazon S3 website endpoint for the bucket

Each bucket has index.html Style.css and 404-Not-Found.html files that were last changed in April of 2018 and no other files.

AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service) is an order of magnitude cheaper than Elastic Block Store (EBS) or Elastic File System (EFS) storage but not as cheap as the Free of GitHub Pages and does not support the automatic build and publish triggered by a commit using Jekyll I am really liking for static pages.
