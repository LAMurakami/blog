The LAM AWS Dynamic Domain Name Service site main page and Apache2 configuration
are updated by the cloud-init.pl program which applies the public-hostname,
public-ipv4, local-hostname and local-ipv4 values from the
/var/log/cloud-init-output.log file created during the initial boot.

This site builds upon the no-ssl site which includes /Public/Scripts and
more to support additional-sites.

The <a href="http://lamurakami.duckdns.org/README.txt">README</a> file for
this repo outlines the structure of the aws, no-ssl, lam and additional-sites,
the Ubuntu-CloudInit process that launches a new AWS LAM EC2 instance
and more.
