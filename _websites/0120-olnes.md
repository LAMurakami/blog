This site builds upon the no-ssl site which includes /Public/Scripts and
more to support additional-sites.

I have a lot in the Olnes West Subdivision and used this site to document
it and a relationship with the Alaska Mental health Trust Land Office (MHTLO)
which owns most of the lots in the subdivision but does not pay any of
the taxes for the subdivision to the Fairbanks North Star Bourough.

The road that has been platted for decades still does not exist as a
road that vehicles can use.
