The secure website has been my main private website since the early part of this century
when the Army Signal Corps on Fort Wainwright convinced me that a LAMP server with
password authentication should NOT be served up on an un secure website.

The site is currently configured as the default site for traffic on the 443 port.

The site includes a MediaWiki and additional home grown database that has been one of my
main ways of tracking personal information and information related to my relationship
with companies, people and other topics.  The Mediawiki application was added when
I was working for Arctic Region Supercomputing Center as was influenced by their
adoption of an internal wiki using MediaWiki as an official communications platform.

In 2017 I implemented the https://aws.lam1.us LAM AWS VPC powered clone of the
LAM Secure Website after my home had been burgled earlier in the year.
At the time my home in Alaska was burgled I was on my annual vacation in
Cabo San Lucas, Baja Califirnia, Sur, Mexico and had been manualy maintaining
one of my laptops https://ak16.lam1.us as a clone of https://ak7.lam1.us
and actually first noticed the burglary when unable to connect to the LAM AK server.
