This site builds upon the no-ssl site which includes /Public/Scripts and
more to support additional-sites.

My brother hosted his site on my server for nearly 10 years from November 2008.

As of 2019 the muramg.info domain name is no longer his.

The <a href="http://mike.lam1.us/About">About Mr. M's Website</a> page
was under my control and includes a log of some interactions between my brother
and myself about the website.
